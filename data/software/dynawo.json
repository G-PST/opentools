    "description": "Dyna\u03c9o is an hybrid C++/Modelica open source suite of simulation tools for power systems. It aims at providing power system stakeholders with a transparent, flexible, interoperable and robust suite of simulation tools that could ease collaboration and cooperation in the power system community.  To achieve this goal, Dyna\u03c9o is based on two mains principles: the use of a high-level modelling language Modelica and a strict separation between the modelling and the solving parts.",
