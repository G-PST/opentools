    "description": "DPsim is a real-time capable power system simulator that supports dynamic phasor and electromagnetic transient simulation as well as continuous power flow. It primarily targets large-scale scenarios on commercial off-the-sheld hardware that require deterministic time steps in the range of micro- to milliseconds.",
