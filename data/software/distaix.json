    "description": "DistAIX (Distributed Agent-based SImulation of CompleX Power Systems) is a simulator for cyber-physical power distribution systems that makes use of high performance computing techniques to scale up the simulation. An agent-based modeling and simulation approach is applied to model the behavior of the electrical system as well as distributed control and decision-making processes. Communication between participants of the system (agents) is also modeled and simulated.",
