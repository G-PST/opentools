    "description": "PowerModels.jl is a Julia package for Steady-State Power Network Optimization. It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging power network formulations and algorithms in a common platform. The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g. Power Flow, Optimal Power Flow, ...) from the power network formulations (e.g. AC, DC-approximation, SOC-relaxation, ...). This enables the definition of a wide variety of power network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.",
