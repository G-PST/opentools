    "description": "VILLAS is framework for coupling test beds and real-time simulators between geographically distributed laboratories. The development of VILLAS is mainly driven by RWTH Aachen University and was originally designed here for geographically distributed real-time simulation of electrical networks, but can also be used without restrictions for simulation in other domains as well as multi-physical systems.",
