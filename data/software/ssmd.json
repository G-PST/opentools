    "description": "Matlab code to generate the state-space A and B matrices of electrical distribution grids, including inverter, loads and lines components. The slack bus can be selected depending on the type of grid (conventional- or micro-grid). The matrices can also be used to run any time simulation, with user-defined inputs and disturbances and selecting simulation time stamp and duration.",
