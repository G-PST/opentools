    "description": "Python package pycity_scheduling is a framework for the effective development, testing, and assessment of optimization-based power scheduling algorithms for local multi-energy systems in city districts. The framework primarily targets the elaboration of coordination concepts that can efficiently solve the power dispatch problem on the city district level. Its target users are researchers in the field of smart grid applications and the deployment of operational flexibility for local energy systems.",
