    "description": "ParaEMT is a power system electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulator, that has been developed (at NREL) for providing a powerful and flexible platform for simulating EMT of large-scale inverter-based resource (IBR)-dominated power systems leveraging parallel computing. ParaEMT has been fully open source since June 2023 at GitHub, to foster a community of EMT simulation and assist in exploring new EMT algorithms and applying advanced computational techniques to EMT simulation.",
